# HumHub Module Editor
Create and edit HumHub modules via UI

**Note:** This module is meant for HumHub developers only. Editing module files can break your site.
So be careful, have a backup at hand and another way to edit files in case something went wrong.

## Editor

The following file types are supported:

- php, html
- js
- css, less
- md, json
- sh
- gitignore, yaml
- plain text files

**You can also create, rename and delete files.**
